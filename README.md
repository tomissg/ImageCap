# ImageCap

This is my first practice project in using COCO dataset (2017 edition) for Image captioning 

In this projet I created a simple model with a VGG16 based CNN encoder and an LSTM decoder 

The training process needs more time to get significant results my goal ws to simply work and try to do what it suposed to do
